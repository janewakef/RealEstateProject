# RealEstateProject

This project consists of scraping a real estate website for data on recently sold homes in the Columbus, OH area. We then created a model that uses information about these homes to predict the price they were sold for. We will use this model to predict the selling prices of homes that are currently for sale to determine if they will sell for above or below the asking price.


### Software

This project is done in Python to allow us to learn the language and its capabilities. The visualization is made in Tableau.
